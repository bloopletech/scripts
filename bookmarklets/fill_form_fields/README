Fill Form Fields
================

This script will:

* Change the value of all text fields, password fields and textareas to 'testString', unless the name of the field contains:
  * 'email', in which case the value of the field is changed to a random Mailinator address;
  * 'date', in which case the value is changed to the current date in dd mmm yyyy format. 
* Select the last option in every drop-down;
* Check every checkbox on the page;
* Select the last radio button in every radio button group.

To run the script, just add a bookmark to your browser, setting the bookmark url to the contents of fill_form_fields.js (so the url should start with 'javascript:').
